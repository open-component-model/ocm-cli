# ocm-cli

## About this project

The [`ocm` CLI](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/tree/main/docs/reference/ocm.md) may also be used to interact with OCM mechanisms. It makes it easy to create component versions and embed them in build processes.

The `ocm` CLI documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm.md).

The code for the CLI can be found in [packageÂ `cmds/ocm`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/cmds/ocm).

The OCI and OCM support can be found in packages
[`pkg/contexts/oci`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/pkg/contexts/oci) and [`pkg/contexts/ocm`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/pkg/contexts/ocm).
